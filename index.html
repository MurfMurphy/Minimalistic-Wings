        <p><strong>Did he speak to you? Would you just answer? What things? What people?
         A month ago, REDACTED was trying to kill both of us. And now, he pulls you out of 
         the lab and employs you as... what... a, an assistant gunman? A tough guy?
         Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. 
         What kind of game is he playing. Does he think you're that na√Øve? He can't truly 
         think that you'd forget... let alone Gale, let alone Victor... and all the 
         horror that goes along with all of that. </strong></p>
